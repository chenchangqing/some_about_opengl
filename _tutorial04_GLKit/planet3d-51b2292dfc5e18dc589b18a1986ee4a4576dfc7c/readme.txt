I was looking for a textured sphere sample code starting point, and couldn't find anything appropriate or simple for iOS, so I made one!
 
Added texturing and input (rotate, pinch to zoom, tap to change texture)
	 
I freely admit I know nothing about OpenGL|ES but since I couldn't find something that did this when I started, maybe this will be of use to someone.
 
I use massive textures (4096x2048) so you might want to reduce those if trying this on an older device
